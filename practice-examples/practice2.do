* PRACTICE EXAMPLES AFTER SESSION 2
*-----------------------------------
* Programming Tools, CEU, Winter 2015

* TASK 1: sum of first 1000 even numbers
*--------------------------------------
* Write a for loop which counts the sum of the first 1000 even numbers.


* TASK 2: Analysis of the aggregated panel data
*-----------------------------------------------
/* Let us begin with the aggregated trade data (which consists of all years
   from 2003 to 2013) set as panel. Create a new variable which shows how many
   observations do you have for each country (hint: use egen with count method).
   Keep only those countries which have exports and (general) imports data for
   each year, that is balance your panel. Run a regression of the differences in
   log of exports on the differences in log of imports (create the
   log-differences by using foreach and time series operator. Run the same
   regression only for years between 2008-2012 (that for log changes between
   2008-09, 2009-10, 2010-11, 2011-12. Return the results in a nicely formatted
   table. */
